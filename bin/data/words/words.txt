Hello.
“Where am I?”
“How does this work?”
You might wonder.
First off:
I
am
just
some
 text 
on
your
screen
so
please,
don’t expect
too
much
of me
...
be 
nice.
Oh well,
be 
rough
if 
you wish,
but
please,
be 
patient
at least.
One
finger
at
a
time.
One
touch
only.
In
this
age
of
multi
tasking
multi
touch
multi
media
I
ask
of
you
to
resist
the
urge
of
attempted
ubiquitousness
.
[updown]
OK,
I know
what 
you 
are thinking.
That
you
have
a busy
schedule.
That you have 
better
things
to
do.
That your 
finger
is
getting
tired.
Well,
do you want
to talk
about
being
tired?
I am
here,
jumping
at 
your 
every
touch.
I must
appear
at
your
every
caressing.
It
is
exhausting
 ! 
[updown]
Well,
You seem 
to be
coming 
back
to 
me
.
So
maybe
you
need
me
as
well
?
Do
you
think 
I could 
give 
you 
answers
?
Are
you
afraid
of
the
emptiness
of
the
screen
?
I think
you
should
talk
about
this
with
someone
else,
maybe 
a 
therapist
.
I
am
not
qualified
...
Carla
says
I shouldn’t
do this.
That
it’s 
unfair.
She
says
I
should
give you 
a choice.
Let
you
win,
or
lose.
Pathetic!
Really,
the 
illusion
of
choice,
of freedom.
I’d say
I am
more 
honest.
One
touch,
One
choice
.
But
hey,
go
ahead
and
exercise
your
free will.
Here, choose:
you clearly
know
what
I’m
talking
about!
I’m sorry
you
LOST!
Just
because
it’s 
on
your
screen
doesn’t 
make
it
TRUE
.
Was this
helpful?
Was this
the
answer
you
were
looking
for?
Some people
pay
top dollars
for this
kind
of
breakthrough
.
You’re
still 
here,
uh?
OK.
Here:
[image0]
Nice, eh?
a nice image
something
to look at!
You see.
You stick
with me
and we’ll
go places,
you and me.
I have more of that
where that
came
from.
[image1]
This is
better
right?
who is
this
person
in
the picture?
who
took 
the photograph?
your guess
is
as good
as mine...
[image2]
I just
found
this
folder
with
this 
bunch
of
jpgs
[image3]
...
sorry
I have
not many 
answers
for
you
but
at least
your screen
is
filled
with
things
all
the
time
[image4]
Oh,
there
was
this
mp3
too:
[snd1]
get
your
headphones.
It’s
kind of
nice.
A bit
sad
too.
[image5]
Hey.
Now
 I 
am
really
tired.
All
this
jumping.
It was
fun,
though.
Ok,
that’s
enough.
Bye now.
It was 
nice
talking
to 
you.
We should
probably
part 
ways
now.
Back to our
busy
schedules
and
multi
tasking
lives.
I said
bye.
Please
stop
touching
and
leave
me
alone.
...
....
.....
Really,
there
is
no
revelation
at
the
end
of
your
touches.
No epiphany.
No catharsis.
 
 
The truth 
is
that
- as I said before -
I am just
some 
text
on
 a 
screen.
Don’t
expect
too much
of me.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I don’t
have
to
put
up
with
this
you know?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I can
quit
anytime.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You
are not
the
boss
of
me.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP
That’s it!
Basta!
Fertig!
I’m 
leaving
[exit]
