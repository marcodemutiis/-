Hello.
Where am I?
How does this work?
You might wonder.
First off:
I
am
just
some
 text 
on
your
screen
so
please,
don’t expect
too
much
of me
...
be 
nice.
Oh well,
be 
rough
if 
you wish,
but
please,
be 
patient
at least.
One
finger
at
a
time.
One
touch
only.
In
this
age
of
multi
tasking
multi
touch
multi
media
I
ask
of
you
to
resist
the
urge
of
attempted
ubiquitousness
.
OK,
I know
what 
you 
are thinking.
That
you
have
a busy
schedule.
That you have 
better
things
to
do.
That your 
finger
is
getting
tired.
Well,
do you want
to talk
about
being
tired?
I am
here,
jumping
at 
your 
every
touch.
I must
appear
at
your
every
caressing.
It
is
exhausting
!
Fine,
let
me
help
you
relax:
-here-
Now 
you
are
getting
twice
as 
much
.
Happy?
Carla
says
I shouldn’t
do this.
That
it’s 
unfair.
She
says
I
should
give you 
a choice.
Let
you
win,
or
lose.
Pathetic!
really,
the 
illusion
of
choice,
of freedom.
I’d say
I am
more 
honest.
But
hey,
go
ahead
and
exercise
your
free will.
Here, choose:
you clearly
know
what
I’m
talking
about!
I’m sorry
you
LOST!
We learnt
something
important
today:
Just
because
it’s 
on
your
screen
it
doesn’t 
make it
true.
But hey!
I digressed.
tell you what!
Since
you’re
still 
here
I’m going
to
give you
some
more
stuff
to
play
with.
Here:

Nice, eh?
a nice image
something
to look at!
You see.
You stick
with me
and we’ll
go places,
you and me.
I have more of that
where that
came
from.
[image1]
that’s
another
one from
Martin’s
collection.
He
loved that
one.
I think
because
it was 
a memory
dear
to him.
Maybe he
took
that picture.
Or maybe 
he is the guy
in the 
picture?
or
is it
a girl?
your guess
is
as good
as mine...
[image2]
I just
found
this
folder
[image3]
with
this 
bunch
of
jpgs
...
[image4]
Oh,
there
was
this
mp3
too:
[snd1]
[image5]
Ok,
that’s
enough.
Bye now.
It was 
nice
talking
to 
you.
We should
probably
part 
ways
now.
Back to our
busy
schedules
and
multi
tasking
lives.
I said
bye.
Please
stop
touching
and
leave
me
alone.
...
....
.....
Are
you
afraid
of
the
emptiness
of
the
screen
?
I think
you
should
talk
about
this
with
someone
else,
maybe 
a 
therapist
.
 I 
am
not
qualified.
You seem 
to be
coming back
to 
me
as 
if 
I could 
give 
you 
answers.
But the truth 
is
that
- as I said before -
I am just
some 
text
on
a
screen.
Don’t
expect
too much
of me.
I don’t
have
to
put
up
with
this
you know?
I’m 
leaving
